done - 3 - The Spinning Wheel: Imagine a special table, kind of like a workstation, but with no UI.
                Instead, it looks like a wheel. When you right-click on it with a fluffy tuft
                (which is already implemented), the appearance of the wheel changes.
                After you've placed three tufts on the wheel, it goes back to its original look and produces a
                fluffy thread as a result.
				 
			addition by laz:
				empty wheel + tuft -> wheel stage 1
				wheel stage 1 + tuft -> wheel stage 2
				wheel stage 2 + tuft -> wheel stage 3
				wheel stage 3 + right click -> empty wheel + gives thread
				wheel stage 1-3 + shift right click -> gives back the tuft on the wheel

				The spinning wheel uses wood sounds.

				When tuft is placed on the wheel it makes a wool placing sound.

				When thread is made from the wheel it makes a wool breaking sound.

				Crafting recipe:
				B = Modded Planks
				C = Fluff Tuft

				BBB
				BCB
				BBB

				Assets used are:

				Spinning Wheel:
						spinning_wheel_stage_0.png
						spinning_wheel_stage_1.png
						spinning_wheel_stage_2.png
						spinning_wheel_stage_3.png

						model = spinning_wheel.json



				Input = Fluff tuft item (already implemented)
				Output = Fluff thread item (already implemented)

done - 4 - The Architect Table: A custom stonecutter variant.
				The architect table uses stone sounds.
				Crafting recipe:
				C = Modded Planks
				D = Polished Shale Slab

				DD
				CC

				The textures used are:

				front and back = architect_table_front.png
				sides = architect_table_side.png
				top = workstation_top.png
				bottom = polished_shale.png


done - 5 - An overgrown shale block that works similar to grass
				(when other blocks are placed on grass blocks they revert to the dirt)
				The overgrown shale would revert to a shale block which is already fully implemented.

				The textures used are:

				overgrown_shale.png
				overgrown_shale_top.png

				shale.png
				

6 - Bubble block, a transparent block that you can bounce on.

				Textures used are:

				bubble_block.png

				These will break if broken with your hand or any tool and will not show particles.

				You can only pick these up in an empty vessel (already implemented) and get a bubble vessel.

				item texture = bubble_vessel.png

				The break and place sounds for this are the same as the Minecraft item drop sound.
				
			addition by laz:
				blockpicking (mouse wheel click) gives a bubble vessel
				block also wanishes if a projectile hits it
