1 - Bug Fixes/ Additional Features to Existing Assets

        Fixes:
            -When walking on overgrown shale it should sound like moss.
            -Architect Table says stonecutter when UI is opened and should say "Architect Table".
            -Bubble Blocks break when touched by water.

        Additional Features:
            -Bubble Bulb has lever sounds when turned on and off.
            -Echo flowers can be placed on overgrown shale, shale, and fluffy shale(seen below).
            -Both saplings should be able to be placed on overgrown shale and fluffy shale(seen below).
            -Both saplings should be pottable.
            -When you shift while standing on a bubble block it pops.
            -You can right click a fully grown mint crop to harvest it.

 2 - Fluffy Shale: Works exactly like overgrown shale, bonemeal works the same, it reverts to shale when blocks are placed on it,
     and the block makes wool sounds when you walk and stone sounds when you place and break it.

     side textures: fluffy_shale.png
     bottom texture: shale.png

 2 - Plants: All of the following plants can be placed on overgrown shale and fluffy shale.
  Only breakable with shears:
        -shale sprouts (can be placed on normal shale as well)
        -tuft
        -glowing shale sprouts (same luminance as glow lichen and can be placed on normal shale as well)
        -shale grass (has a bottom and top texture)
        -fluff vines
                -fluff vines are only placeable on the bottom of fluff blocks, they do not grow unless bonemealed.
                -fluff vines have multiple textures (fluff_vines.png, fluff_vines_bottom.png)
                -fluff vines are like glow berry vines in the sense that they have a crosshair, they are not a flat plane like normal vines.
                -they are climbale
  Can be broken with your hand:
        -glowcap cluster (have a luminance of 10)
        -glowcap (have a luminance of 10, can be potted)
        -crottle (glow lichen clone, same luminance as glow lichen)
        -indigo cosmos (can be potted and have a luminance of 5)
        Succulents:
        Succulents generate like coral fans in their model, they can also be potted and when they are potted they use the flower model with two
        2D crosshair.
            -pink succulent
            -blue succulent
            -purple succulent

  3 - Panicle
        Panicle are a clone of sugar cane, however they can be placed no matter how much water is there.
        Panicle can grow to be 3-4 blocks in height, and can be bonemealed.
        Panicle that are fully grown (3-4 blocks) will grow florets that can be harvested by breaking them or right clicking
         breaking them will cause another one to grow over time, right clicking will harvest the florets.

         Textures:
         panicle.png (already implemented, this is the item texture)
         panicle_florets.png (already implemented, this is the item texture for the flowers)
         panicle_stalks.png (block texture)
         panicle_flowers.png (flower texture)
         panicle_flowers_harvested.png (harvested flowers texture)

  4 - Sugar Plum Crop
         Sugar plums are already implemented.

         Changes to the sugar plum:
            -Sugar plums now have a 50% chance to drop a sugar plum pit (sugar_plum_pit.png) when eaten.
            -Sugar plum pits can be thrown and will do 2-3 hp if they hit something.

            Sugar plum plants can be grown 1 of 2 ways.

            1st is natural generation, in the world, sugar plums will generate from the cyclade tree leaves, there
            are sprouts that come from the trees.

            cyclade sprout.png are the cyclade sprouts, they can only be placed on the underside of cyclade leaves (in code as verdant leaves).
            cyclade sprouts do not drop when they are broken even if they are broken with shears.

            crop stages:
            stage 1: cyclade_sprout.png and plum_tree_sprout_png.
            stage 2: cyclade_sprout.png and plum_tree_flower.png
            stage 3: cyclade_sprout.png and unripe_plum.json/ unripe_plum.png
            stage 4: cyclade_sprout.png and ripe_plum.json/ ripe_plum.png

            2nd is by planting the sugar plum pit.

            stage 1: plum_crop_0.png
            stage 2: plum_crop_1_bottom.png and plum_crop_1_top.png
            stage 3: plum_crop_2_bottom.png and plum_crop_2_top.png and unripe_plum.json/unripe_plum.png
            stage 4: plum_crop_3_bottom.png and plum_crop_3_top.png and ripe_plum.json/ripe_plum.png

            You will not get anything if you break the crops unless they are fully grown, alternativley, you can right-click to harvest the plum.

            referecne the photo I sent in discord dms to see what the crop stages look like on the tree and on the ground.

  5 - Sulfur
        Sulfur Crystals are already implemented in game.

        +Sulfur crystals can be used as fuel and have the same fuel as coal.

        +Add sulfur block, if broken with a pickaxe it will drop 2-4 sulfur crystals. (sulfur_block.png)

        Crafting recipe:

        A = sulfur crystals

        AA
        AA

        Alternatively, you can craft a sulfur block into 4 sulfur crystals.

        A = sulfur block.

        A

        +Sulfur cluster (sulfur_cluster.png)

        If broken with your fist or a pickaxe, clusters will drop 1-2 sulfur crystals.
        If broken with shears they will drop the sulfur cluster.
